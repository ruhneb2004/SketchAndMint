## SonthamNft

This is a very minimal contract for making an Nft. The users are the ones who will be adding Nft images and it's details, after some time I will be updating the contract so that the users if selling the contract to opensea or something will have to pay a small fee to me. I don't know how secure it will be but I will give it a go anyways!

Try to make changes in here or something, also the cost of minting the NFT is going to be astronomical as the data to be stored onchain is pretty large but it's a fun little project so whateves
